How to run Auto3dgm locally.

0) Download the repo
0.1) Go to https://github.com/hkirvesl/Auto3dgm-matlab
0.2) Click Clone/Download -> Download ZIP
0.3) Save somewhere and unzip

1) Verify you have Matlab installed (You might need Biostuff and optimization toolkit installed as well, if matlab complains about this)
2) Verify you have mosek installed
Installing mosek:

2.1)Follow the instructions in: 
https://www.mosek.com/downloads/

N.B. If you are running Windows, install mosek to a directory that does not have spaces in the file path. Having spaces in the file path may cause Mosek .mex file problems.

2.2)Once done, request a personal academic licence
https://www.mosek.com/products/academic-licenses/

2.3)You will receive an email from Mosek containing mosek.lic.

2.4) Put the mosek .lic file to the following two locations:

2.4.1) The directory where you installed mosek
2.4.2) In the auto3dgm repo, software/mosek (you may customize this path in the jadd_path.m file)

3) Editing jadd_path.m

In the folder where you downloaded the repo, edit /code/jadd_path.m:

3.1)meshesPath = the path to the folder where you have your unaligned shapes (.off files)
3.2)outputPath = the path to the folder where you want the analysis output to be stored
3.3) set use_cluster = 0 to enable local parallel run

N.B. If you are running windows, remember to use "\" instead of "/" when specifying the path. Also remember to put the final "/"

4) Start Matlab
4.1)set matlab directory to the folder where you installed the repo/code
4.1.1) If you are running GPR, make sure the folder /software/ is added to the matlab path. If unsure, do the following:
4.1.1.1) In matlab navigate home-Set path - Add with subfolders, and select the whole code repo (folder that includes both code and software folders, one level above the /code folder)
4.1.1.2) then click save. If it doesnâ€™t allow you to save, you can save the defpath file e.g. in the code folder. After saving you can close.
4.1.1.3) If you needed to create a defpath file, run the defpath by typing "defpath" in the console.


4.2.1)for sequential execution, run main.m by typing "main" in the console
4.2.2)for parallel execution, follow the instructions in https://github.com/trgao10/PuenteAlignment
